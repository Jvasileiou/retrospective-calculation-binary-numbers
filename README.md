## Introduction 

The purpose of this lab is to learn the Retrospective Calculation Number of population of data in a table : 
+ Recursion in assembly
It is known that the recursion is a technique that solves a "big problem solving smaller versions of the same
problem and by using the results of these solutions it calculates its result
a major problem. The central idea is that the smaller problems, break into even smaller,
until their solution is trivial.
For example, a refresh can be used to sort a table using the method
merge sort: the table is divided into two parts, half-size, which first
are classified each separately and then merged into a single table, comparing them
elements of the subpairs in pairs in turn. The smallest element in each subtab will be
first in the subfield, so comparing the first two elements at a time we can easily
merge the two subpages into one.
Reflection allows very compact and elegant solutions to a problem although they often lag behind
execution speed. To solve a flashback problem, it must be able to express itself with such
so that solving a N-size problem is exactly the same as solving a problem
smaller size.
